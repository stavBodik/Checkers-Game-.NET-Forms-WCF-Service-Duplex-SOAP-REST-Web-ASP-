# Checkers-Game-.NET-Forms-WCF-Service-Duplex-SOAP-REST-Web-ASP-


<div>
  This project was implemented during .NET Networking course at <a href="https://english.afeka.ac.il/">Afeka Academic College of Engineering.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  The main study idea of the project was to create a client-server game "checkers" where team of players can play on-line against each another.
  <br>
  The project consist of 3 sub projects :
  <br><br>
  1. Checkers Service, main server which providing service for game and web-site clients.
  <br>
  2. Client application, the game itself.
  <br>
  3. Web application, game web-site where users can register and create hosting rooms for games or join other players game, also providing different information from DB to the players.
  <br><br>
  The project implements:
  <br><br>
  1. The use of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/whats-wcf">
  WCF</a> Service implementing <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/duplex-services">Duplex</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> pattern's in order to communicate with the game client and web-site.
  <br>
  2. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/">LINQ to SQL</a>, automatic reflection of DB into C# classes (Object Relational Mapping) which providing nice syntax in order to perform queries on the DB.
  <br>
  3. <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet">ASP.NET</a>
  <br>
  4. Interesting graphics implementation using .NET Forms such as animations or multiply layers of UI components up on each other with transparent background in order to create more realistic game.
  <br>
  5. MVC (Model View Control) Architecture on the game client side.
